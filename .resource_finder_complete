Papers downloaded: 20
Datasets downloaded: 5
Repositories cloned: 5

Key deliverables:
- papers/: 20 PDF papers on LLMs for scientific discovery, knowledge gaps, and funding bias
- datasets/: DiscoveryBench, ScienceAgentBench, NSF Awards, ArXiv Papers, SciCite
- code/: DiscoveryBench, ScienceAgentBench, AI-Scientist, Awesome-LLM-Scientific-Discovery, Impact-Big-Tech-Funding
- literature_review.md: Comprehensive synthesis of 20 papers
- resources.md: Complete resource catalog

Research hypothesis support:
- GAPMAP paper demonstrates LLMs can identify explicit and implicit knowledge gaps
- Knowledge Gaps/Silos paper provides framework for citation-based gap analysis
- Big Tech Funding paper shows funding-driven research attention biases
- FIND NSF paper provides funding-publication linkage data
- Multiple benchmarks available for evaluating discovery capabilities

Recommended next steps:
1. Use DiscoveryBench + NSF Awards for gap identification experiments
2. Adapt AI-Scientist idea generation for gap-focused prompting
3. Implement citation network analysis from Knowledge Gaps/Silos methodology
4. Evaluate against expert-annotated gaps (create or use GAPMAP dataset)
