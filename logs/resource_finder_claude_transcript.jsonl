The resource gathering phase is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Resource Finding Complete

### Papers Downloaded: 20
Located in `papers/` - covering:
- LLM scientific discovery surveys and taxonomies
- Research idea generation benchmarks (DiscoveryBench, ScienceAgentBench, IdeaBench, ResearchBench)
- Knowledge gap identification methods (GAPMAP, Citation Network Analysis)
- Funding bias analysis (Big Tech funding impact)
- Automated scientific discovery frameworks (AI Scientist, ResearchAgent, SciMON)

### Datasets Available: 5
Located in `datasets/` with samples and download instructions:
- **DiscoveryBench**: 264 real + 903 synthetic discovery tasks
- **ScienceAgentBench**: 102 tasks across 4 scientific disciplines
- **NSF Awards**: 523,369 grant awards for funding analysis
- **ML-ArXiv-Papers**: 117,592 papers for topic analysis
- **SciCite**: Citation intent classification

### Code Repositories Cloned: 5
Located in `code/`:
- **discoverybench**: Discovery agents and evaluation
- **scienceagentbench**: Science agent evaluation framework
- **ai-scientist**: End-to-end automated research pipeline
- **awesome-llm-scientific-discovery**: Curated paper list
- **impact-big-tech-funding**: Funding bias analysis scripts

### Key Documentation Created:
- `literature_review.md`: Comprehensive synthesis of 20 papers
- `resources.md`: Complete resource catalog
- `papers/README.md`, `datasets/README.md`, `code/README.md`: Detailed documentation

### Key Findings for Research Hypothesis:
The literature strongly supports the hypothesis that LLMs can identify under-researched topics:
1. GAPMAP demonstrates LLM capability in identifying explicit and implicit knowledge gaps
2. Big Tech funding analysis shows research attention is driven by funding, creating biases
3. Citation network analysis can reveal knowledge silos and isolated research areas
4. Multiple benchmarks exist for evaluating discovery capabilities
