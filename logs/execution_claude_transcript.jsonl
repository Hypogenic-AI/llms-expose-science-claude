The research is complete. Let me provide a summary.

## Research Session Complete

I have successfully completed a full research cycle investigating whether LLMs can identify under-researched but high-impact scientific topics. Here's what was accomplished:

### Key Results

**All three hypotheses were supported:**

1. **H1 (Attention Estimation)**: LLMs accurately estimate research attention
   - Spearman r = 0.76, p < 0.001

2. **H2 (Gap Identification)**: LLMs distinguish between well-funded and neglected topics
   - Cohen's d = 1.18, p = 0.005
   - Mean gap score for true gaps: +1.67 vs -0.45 for others

3. **H3 (Cross-Model Consistency)**: GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet show high agreement
   - Gap score correlation: r = 0.97, p = 0.005
   - 100% agreement on top-3 gaps

### Top Identified Research Gaps
1. Neglected Tropical Diseases Detection (gap = +3.0)
2. AI for Low-Resource Languages (gap = +2.0)
3. Small-Scale Farmer Decision Support (gap = +2.0)
4. Maternal Mortality Risk Prediction (gap = +2.0)
5. Educational AI for Underserved Communities (gap = +2.0)

### Deliverables Created
- **REPORT.md**: Comprehensive 18KB research report with all findings
- **README.md**: Project overview and quick-start guide
- **planning.md**: Experimental design document
- **src/experiment.py**: Main experiment script (~27KB)
- **src/model_comparison.py**: Cross-model validation (~9KB)
- **results/**: JSON and CSV outputs with raw data
- **figures/**: 4 visualizations (attention vs impact scatter, gap scores bar chart, validation boxplots, domain analysis)

The research demonstrates that LLMs can indeed serve as "gap detectors" to identify scientific topics that are under-researched relative to their societal importance.
